#### I had NOT downloaded SQL Express somehow I missed that step every time that I attempted this project/lab.  I have added it now, and refreshed and tried to update the file accordingly, but I'm sure that something is off.  I have followed along the tutoriial video (several times) and used it as a guide, along with the book, but I think I just got scatterbrained.  I'm currently working on a set of notes to make the steps easier for me (hopefully).
